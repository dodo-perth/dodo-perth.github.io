## Questions
Given two strings s and goal, return true if and only if s can become goal after some number of shifts on s.

A shift on s consists of moving the leftmost character of s to the rightmost position.

For example, if s = "abcde", then it will be "bcdea" after one shift.
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcde", goal = "cdeab"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "abcde", goal = "abced"
Output: false
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length, goal.length <= 100
s and goal consist of lowercase English letters.

## Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool rotateString(string s, string goal) {
        s.append(s);
        if(s.find(goal) != string::npos && s.length()/2 == goal.length()) return true;
        return false;
    }
};
```
This was leetcode daily challenge.
If the given s is abcde, then s+s is abcdeabcde.
If goal is cdeab, then it should be in abcdeabcde.
If the length of goal is not half of the length of s, then it is not possible to rotate s to goal.
